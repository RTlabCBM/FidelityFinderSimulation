## Introduction

Python script to simulate an RT-PCR experiment incorporating cDNA barcoding and NGS sequencing. The purpose of the program is to assess the ability of single-strand consensus sequencing (SSCS) to evaluate the fidelity of reverse transcriptases, as well as its accuracy in discarding errors introduced during library preparation and sequencing.

Single Strand Consensus Sequencing method to determine the fidelity of reverse transcriptases:
![Workflow](https://github.com/RTlabCBM/FidelityFinder/blob/main/docs/images/Primers_IDs_method.PNG?raw=true)

The program initiates by generating a specified number of cDNA sequences (`initial_seq_number`) with a length defined by `seq_len`. A barcode (also known as Unique Molecular Identifier) is assigned to each cDNA sequence. The length of the barcode can be specified with `barcode_len` parameter. Random mutations are introduced to the cDNA sequences based on the probability defined by the `RT_error_rate parameter`. These mutations emulate transcription and reverse transcription errors.

Subsequently, the cDNAs are then amplified through the indicated PCR cycles with a probability of introducing errors in the sequences (determined by `PCR_error_rate`) or in the barcodes associated (`PCR_error_rate_for_barcodes`). `PCR_selection_rate` governs the proportion of sequences amplified during each PCR cycle, thereby simulating PCR bias.

Following PCR amplification, a subset of sequences (determined by `NGS_reads_number`) undergoes sequencing simulation. Errors may be introduced in the sequences or their associated barcodes, as defined by `NGS_error_rate` and `NGS_error_rate_for_barcodes`. Additionally, the program also allows the introduction of errors in specific positions of the barcodes with varying probabilities, controlled by `NGS_error_rate_for_barcodes_hotspots` and modulated by `hotspots_module`. A `hotspots_module` of 2 introduces errors in even positions of the barcodes, while a value higher than `barcode_len` has no effect. 

Single nucleotide substitution errors are the sole type of simulated errors.

## Quick start
The program is available as a Jupyter Notebook. It can be opened and run with the following Google Colab link: [fidelity_finder_simulation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RTlabCBM/FidelityFinderJupyter/blob/main/JupyterNotebooks/fidelity_finder_simulation.ipynb)

## Input parameters

These are the parameters that can be provided as input together with example values:

- Number of cDNA sequences that are generated by reverse transciption
```console
initial_seq_number = 3000
```
- Length of the initial_sequences (nt)
```console
seq_len = 300
```
- Length of the barcode added to each sequence (nt)
```console
barcode_len = 14
```
- Error rate during reverse transcription
```console
RT_error_rate = 0.00002
```
- Number of PCR cycles
```console
PCR_cycles_number = 15
```
- Proportion of sequences that are amplified in each PCR cycle (0.0-1.0)
```console
PCR_selection_rate = 0.3
```
- Error rate during each cycle of PCR
```console
PCR_error_rate = 0.00003
```
- Error rate during each cycle of PCR for barcode amplification
```console
PCR_error_rate_for_barcodes = 0.00003
```
